# Logical-Statements-Calculator


This Python script serves as a powerful tool for checking the validity of any number of logical arguments by evaluating the truth values of given logical sentences. It provides a basic yet simple user interface for constructing logical statements, applying various logical connectives, and determining the overall validity of the argument.

## Key Features:

### Versatile Logical Connectives

The script supports a range of logical connectives, including conditional, conjunction, inclusive or, exclusive or, biconditional, negation, and more.
Each connective is implemented as a separate function, making the code modular and easy to understand.

### Dynamic User Interaction

Users are prompted to input truth values for atomic sentences and choose logical connectives.
The script dynamically guides users on the proper input format for each connective, ensuring accurate operations.

### Validity Determination

The script uses a systematic approach to check the validity of the logical argument.
It employs the concept of sufficiency and necessity, verifying that all logical sentences are true simultaneously for a set to be considered valid.


### Continuous Set Building

Users have the option to continue adding more statements to the logical set, creating complex arguments.
The script efficiently stores and processes the truth values of each statement in the set.

### Clear Output

The final determination of the argument's validity is presented directly to the user.
The code outputs whether the logical set is valid or invalid based on the truth values provided.
